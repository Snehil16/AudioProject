# Fear in the Skies: A Flight Emergency


# Project Description
For this project, our group decided to create a soundscape called “Fear in the Skies: A Flight Emergency” that narrates the story of a flight emergency. The storyline revolves around a specific aircraft that is on a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York and on the way the aircraft and passengers experience severe turbulence. The soundscape mimics the ambiance and atmosphere of the plane prior to and after the turbulence as well as the passenger's reactions. To create our soundscape, we followed the principles we learned in class to structure the storyline, which consists of a beginning, middle, and end. The story begins in the airport at the boarding gate with the boarding announcements and continues with the plane taking off. Then announcements of turbulence are made by the captain and passengers begin to panic. The story concludes with the captain making an emergency landing at the nearest airport that would welcome them. The main idea behind this storyline and soundscape is to portray a flight emergency and show the dread, terror, and relief that passengers feel in such circumstances. The theme we attempt to portray in the storyline is survival and how people can overcome obstacles in such situations. The experience we were striving to create is an immersive and engaging one where we try and take the listener on a journey through sound. We wanted the user to feel as if they were there experiencing the emotions and sensations of the passengers on the plane.


# Process
When receiving this project, as a group we decided what type of audio to create, which was a soundscape with a story, we began brainstorming and coming up with potential themes to explore. Throughout the process, we settled on coming up with a storyline of a flight emergency. As there is a lot of room for creativity, we thought it would be fun to compose the soundscape. We made the outline of the soundscape and the potential sound effects to use. We also decided on what our original sound effects would be, which were the announcements at the airport and aircraft as well as a few passenger sounds. We figured it would be better to record those ourselves and wrote a script for it.

# Reflection/Evaluation
This project had various stages in the process of creation starting from brainstorming, storyline creation, and script to finding sound effects, recording sounds, editing sounds together to fit the theme, and website creation to depict the story of the soundscape. We started with creating the soundscape which helped us reach our final outcome. Listening to sound effects and recording them helped us design the website effectively and efficiently in the best way to represent the soundscape. Our expectations and goals were met, and we were able to execute the soundscape we had in mind as well as the vision of our website to correspond with and host our soundscape.
